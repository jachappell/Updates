# Quote of the Day
<p><em>When they say, "Gee, it's an information explosion!" --no, it's not an explosion, it's a disgorgement of the bowels is what it is. Every idiotic thing that anybody could possibly write or say or think can get into the body politic now --where before things would have to have some merit to go through the publishing routine, now, </em>anything<em>. And all you're getting is an explosion of useless crap, which added to the other useless crap that was being done originally, only makes it that much worse."</em><br /> -- Harlan Ellison</p>
