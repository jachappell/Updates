# Quote of the Day
<p><em>You can cite a hundred references to show that the biblical God is a bloodthirsty tyrant, but if they can dig up two or three verses that say "God is love," they will claim that *you* are taking things out of context!</em><br /> -- Dan Barker (<em>Losing Faith in Faith</em>)</p>
