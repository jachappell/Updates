# Quote of the Day
<p><em>The study of theology, as it stands in Christian churches, is the study of nothing; it is founded on nothing; it rests on no principles; it proceeds by no authorities; it has no data; it can demonstrate nothing; and it admits of no conclusion.</em><br /> -- Thomas Paine (<em>The Age of Reason</em>, 1794)</p>
