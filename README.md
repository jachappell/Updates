# Quote of the Day
<p><em>The truth is that Christian theology, like every other theology, is not only opposed to the scientific spirit; it is also opposed to all other attempts at rational thinking.  Not by accident does Genesis 3 make the father of knowledge a serpent -- slimy, sneaking and abominable.  Since the earliest days the church as an organization has thrown itself violently against every effort to liberate the body and mind of man.  It has been, at all times and everywhere, the habitual and incorrigible defender of bad governments, bad laws, bad social theories, bad institutions.  It was, for centuries, an apologist for slavery, as it was the apologist for the divine right of kings.</em><br /> -- H.L. Mencken</p>
