# Quote of the Day
<p><em>What I mean (and everybody else means) by the word QUALITY cannot be broken down into subjects and predicates.  This is not because Quality is so mysterious but because Quality is so simple, immediate, and direct.</em><br /> -- R. Pirsig (<em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em>)</p>
