# Quote of the Day
<p><em>True ornament is not a matter of prettifying externals. It is organic with the structure it adorns, whether a person, a building, or a park. At its best it is an emphasis of structure, a realization in graceful terms of the nature of that which is ornamented.</em><br /> -- Frank Lloyd Wright</p>
