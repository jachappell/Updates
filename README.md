# Quote of the Day
<p><em>Americans like to talk about (or be told about) Democracy but, when put to the test, usually find it to be an 'inconvenience.'  We have opted instead for an authoritarian system </em>disguised<em> as a Democracy.  We pay through the nose for an enormous joke-of-a-government, let it push us around, and then wonder how all those assholes got in there.</em><br /> -- Frank Zappa</p>
