# Quote of the Day
<p><em>I've begun worshipping the sun for a number of reasons.  First of all, unlike some other gods I could mention, I can see the sun.  It's there for me every day.  And the things it brings me are quite apparent all the time:  heat, light, food, a lovely day.  There's no mystery, no one asks for money, I don't have to dress up, and there's no boring pageantry.  And interestingly enough, I have found that the prayers I offer to the sun and the prayers I formerly offered to "God" are all answered at about the same 50-percent rate.</em><br /> -- George Carlin (<em>Brain Droppings</em>)</p>
