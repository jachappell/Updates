# Quote of the Day
<p><em>I think that all good, right thinking people in this country are sick and tired of being told that all good, right thinking people in this country are fed up with being told that all good, right thinking people in this country are fed up with being sick and tired.  I'm certainly not, and I'm sick and tired of being told that I am!</em><br /> -- Monty Python</p>
