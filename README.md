# Quote of the Day
<p><em>"What the hell are you getting so upset about?  I thought you didn't believe in God."<br /><br />"I don't," she sobbed, bursting violently into tears, "but the God I don't believe in is a good God, a just God, a merciful God.  He's not the mean and stupid God you make Him out to be."</em><br /> -- Joseph Heller (<em>Catch-22</em>)</p>
