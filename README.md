# Quote of the Day
<p><em>I have a box of telephone rings under my bed.  Whenever I get lonely, I open it up a little bit, and I get a phone call.  One day I dropped the box all over the floor.  The phone wouldn't stop ringing.  I had to get it disconnected.  So I got a new phone.  I didn't have much money, so I had to get an irregular.  It doesn't have a five.  I ran into a friend of mine on the street the other day.  He said why don't you give me a call.  I told him I can't call everybody I want to anymore, my phone doesn't have a five.  He asked how long had it been that way.  I said I didn't know -- my calendar doesn't have any sevens.</em><br /> -- Stephen Wright</p>
