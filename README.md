# Quote of the Day
<p><em><strong>Percy, Duke of Northumberland</strong>: You know, they do say that the Infanta's eyes are more beautiful than the famous Stone of Galveston.<br /><strong>Prince Edmund, the Black Adder</strong>: Mm! ... What?<br /><strong>Percy</strong>: The famous Stone of Galveston, My Lord.<br /><strong>Edmund</strong>: And what's that, exactly?<br /><strong>Percy</strong>: Well, it's a famous blue stone, and it comes [points dramatically] from Galveston.<br /><strong>Edmund</strong>: I see. And what about it?<br /><strong>Percy</strong>: Well, My Lord, the Infanta's eyes are bluer than it, for a start.<br /><strong>Edmund</strong>: I see. And have you ever seen this stone?<br /><strong>Percy</strong>: [nods] No, not as such, My Lord, but I know a couple of people who have, and they say it's very very blue indeed.<br /><strong>Edmund</strong>: And have these people seen the Infanta's eyes?<br /><strong>Percy</strong>: No, I shouldn't think so, My Lord.<br /><strong>Edmund</strong>: And neither have you, presumably.<br /><strong>Percy</strong>: No, My Lord.<br /><strong>Edmund</strong>: So, what you're telling me, Percy, is that something you have never seen is slightly less blue than something else you have never seen.<br /><strong>Percy</strong>: [finally begins to grasp] Yes, My Lord.<br /><strong>Edmund</strong>: Percy, in the end, you are about as much use to me as an hole in the head...</em><br /> -- Prince Edmund, the Black Adder and Percy, Duke of Northumberland (<em>The Black Adder</em>)</p>
