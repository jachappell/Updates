# Quote of the Day
<p><em>Sham Harga had run a succesful eatery for many years by always smiling, never extending credit, and realizing that most of his customers wanted meals properly balanced between the four food groups: sugar, starch, grease, and burnt crunchy bits.</em><br /> -- Terry Pratchett (<em>Men at Arms</em>)</p>
