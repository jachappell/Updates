# Quote of the Day
<p><em>The intelligent beings in these regions should therefore not be surprised if they observe that their locality in the universe satisfies the conditions that are necessary for their existence. It is a bit like a rich person living in a wealthy neighborhood not seeing any poverty.</em><br /> -- Stephen Hawking</p>
