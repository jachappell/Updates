# Quote of the Day
<p><em>The answer to this is very simple.  It was a joke.  It had to be a number, an ordinary, smallish number, and I chose that one.  Binary representations, base thirteen, Tibetan monks are all complete nonsense.  I sat at my desk, stared into the garden and thought '42 will do' I typed it out.  End of story.</em><br /> -- Douglas Adams (on why "42" is The Answer...)</p>
