# Quote of the Day
<p><em>The new millennium sucks! What a disappointment!  What's the difference between the old millennium and the new millennium? Nothing!  It's the same load of crap with a "2" in the front. When I was a kid, I am old enough so that when I was a kid, I looked forward to the new millennium.  When I was young, I said, "I'm gonna live through a change! A massive change! Things are gonna be different! Things are gonna be great!"  Screwed again!  No flying cars!  No flying cars!</em><br /> -- Lewis Black</p>
