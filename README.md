# Quote of the Day
<p><em>Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed, and in such desperate enterprises? If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.</em><br /> -- Henry David Thoreau</p>
